### Switching Providers
You can switch between providers anytime! The app remembers your API keys and preferred models for each provider.

## üîß Advanced Usage

### Using the Unified API

The app provides a unified interface for all providers:

```typescript
import { useAI } from "@/hooks/useAI";

function MyComponent() {
  const { 
    generateResponse,
    switchProvider,
    getAvailableModels,
    hasApiKey 
  } = useAI("openrouter");

  // Switch provider anytime
  await switchProvider("google");
  
  // Generate response
  const response = await generateResponse(chat, {
    model: "gemini-1.5-flash",
    maxTokens: 1000
  });
}
```

### Streaming Responses

All providers support real-time streaming for a better chat experience:

```typescript
await generateStreamingResponse(
  chat,
  (chunk) => {
    // Handle each chunk as it arrives
    console.log(chunk);
  },
  { model: "gpt-4o", maxTokens: 1000 }
);
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### "No API key found"
- Make sure you've entered your API key in the Configuration tab
- Click "Test API Connection" to verify it's working
- Check that you've selected the right provider

### "Connection failed"
- Verify your API key is correct
- Check your internet connection
- For Ollama: make sure the Ollama server is running locally

### Model not loading
- Wait a moment - models are cached for 24 hours for performance
- Try refreshing the model list in Configuration
- For OpenRouter: you can browse models without an API key

### Poor response quality
- Try a different model (GPT-4 vs GPT-3.5, etc.)
- Adjust the temperature setting
- Check if you're hitting rate limits
