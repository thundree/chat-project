# UI Improvements Update

## Overview
Recent improvements to the chat application's user interface, including message management and configuration organization.

## Changes Made

### Message Deletion Feature
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `src/components/MessageItem.tsx`
  - `src/components/MessageList.tsx`
  - `src/components/ConfirmationModal.tsx`

#### MessageItem Updates
- Added delete button for each individual message
- Integrated with existing `ConfirmationModal` component for delete confirmation
- Enhanced `ConfirmationModal` to support:
  - `confirmColor` prop for customizing confirm button color (e.g., "failure" for delete actions)
  - `loading` prop for showing loading state during operations
- Delete functionality preserves database consistency through existing `deleteMessage` context method
- Consistent styling with existing edit button

#### ConfirmationModal Enhancements
- Added support for `confirmColor` and `loading` props
- Passes through props to underlying `GenericModal`
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing usage

### Configuration Tab Reorganization
- **Files Modified**:
  - `src/components/ChatConfiguration.tsx`
  - `src/components/ChatPanel.tsx`

#### Test API Connection Button Migration
- Moved "Test API Connection" button from main chat area to Configuration tab
- Enhanced `ChatConfiguration` component with:
  - New `onTestApiConnection` prop interface
  - Integrated button within configuration UI
  - Consistent styling with existing configuration elements
- Removed button from `ChatPanel` bottom action area
- Maintains all existing functionality while improving UI organization

## Features Added
- **Message Deletion**: Individual message removal with confirmation dialog
- **Better Organization**: Test API Connection now logically placed in Configuration tab
- **Enhanced Modals**: Improved confirmation modal with loading states and color customization
- **Consistent UX**: All operations follow established patterns and styling

## Technical Implementation
- Leverages existing `deleteMessage` from chat context
- Uses established modal component patterns
- Maintains TypeScript type safety
- Preserves database consistency through existing service layer
- No breaking changes to existing functionality

## User Experience Improvements
- Cleaner main chat interface with fewer action buttons
- Logical organization of testing functionality in configuration
- Safe message deletion with clear confirmation flow
- Loading states provide feedback during operations
- Consistent interaction patterns across the application
